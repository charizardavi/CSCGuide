In CSC405 and 505, you will be writing in Java. To write in Java, we a computer application called an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Basically, its where we write and run our code. For CSC405 at least, there are two main possibilities when it comes to your IDE. Generally, the IDE is decided by your teacher:
- BlueJ: The more teacher-friendly IDE, that allows your teacher to run their unit tests on your code. Its harder to use for a student though.
- Eclipse: A more proper IDE for java, that has code auto-complete aka intellisense, and can run proper java files. 

:::note
Java is what's called an OOP (Object Oriented Programming Language). It is built upon the idea of Objects, which we generally make with classes. You'll learn more about classes later.

Thankfully, your teacher should definitely be able to help you install your IDE.
