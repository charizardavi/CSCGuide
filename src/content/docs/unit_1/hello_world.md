description: Writing your first piece of code.

In Java, we base our code off of functions, which are reusable pieces of code. For example, the one you'll learn about right now is called the print function.

:::note
While we can use Java's premade functions, a lot of the code we write is actually defining our own functions, which we'll discuss later. 
:::

When we run a function, sometimes we need to pass it data. For example, Java's premade `Math.pow()` function takes in two numbers, the base and the exponent. If we want to compute 5<sup>2</sup>, we can use `Math.pow(5,2)`. 

In that previous example, we were passing two numbers, more specifically integers. In Java, we have several types of data, and below are the important ones:
- Integer: called `int` in java, this is any whole number between -2147483648 to 2147483647. Why these numbers, I don't exactly know, but it has something to do with an int being 32 bits. It doesn't matter for your assignments.
